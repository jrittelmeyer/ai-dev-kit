# ai-dev-kit backlog

Forward-only and banded: **B1** do-next → **B4** pivot-only. Rows carry no
shipped-item history (the CHANGELOG owns that) and no duplicated detail — the
*why* and the named deductions behind every row live in the originating audit
report. Every row enters plan → sign-off → build.

(97.1/100, ninth audit — rows 47–54, 47/48/49 shipped; 51–53 are the 2026-08-31 harness
audit's proposals, adopted there). Scored chain — project audits

Retired Watch items: [BACKLOG_WATCH_HISTORY](archive/BACKLOG_WATCH_HISTORY.md).

| Band | # | Area | Item | Lifts | Effort |
|------|---|------|------|-------|--------|
| B4 | 16 | packaging | npm/`npx` packaging — opens on consumer demand (partially superseded by the plugin marketplace) | Public +1 | M |
| B4 | 31 | packaging | Plugin payload hygiene — `source: "./"` ships the whole repo to every consumer's cache; no exclusion mechanism exists (re-verified against the live plugins reference 2026-08-31), so this needs a restructure. **Advised against** at current scale | Public +1 | L |

Watch (externally gated, re-check each audit):

- Harness-side git-root resolution for `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` when sessions
  launch in a subdirectory (kit-side share closed by B1-1). The hooks doc
  defines the placeholder as "the project root **where the session started**"
  with a worktree carve-out; subdirectory launches remain unspecified. Last
  re-check **2026-08-31** (eighth pass since 2026-08-09): changelog swept
  through head **2.1.252** — no root-resolution entry (2.1.248's
  `CLAUDE_CODE_PROJECT_DIR_NAME` names the per-project transcript directory,
  not the root). Gate not lifted. Earlier re-check detail in
  [BACKLOG_WATCH_HISTORY](archive/BACKLOG_WATCH_HISTORY.md).
